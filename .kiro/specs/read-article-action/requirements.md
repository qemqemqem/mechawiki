# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a "read_article" action that allows agents (like reader_agent) to load and retrieve article content by name. The action will provide a standardized tool interface for agents to access article content, returning the full text content in a structured tool call response.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want to provide agents with a read_article tool, so that agents can dynamically load and access article content during their execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent calls the read_article tool with an article name THEN the system SHALL return the complete article content
2. WHEN an agent calls the read_article tool with a valid article name THEN the system SHALL return a successful tool call response containing the article text
3. WHEN an agent calls the read_article tool with an invalid article name THEN the system SHALL return an error response indicating the article was not found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to search for articles by name, so that I can retrieve specific content to process or analyze.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the read_article tool is called with an article name THEN the system SHALL search for the article in the configured content directories
2. WHEN multiple articles with similar names exist THEN the system SHALL return the exact match if available
3. WHEN an article name is provided without file extension THEN the system SHALL search for common text file extensions (.txt, .md)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the read_article tool to handle different file formats, so that agents can access various types of text content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article is in markdown format (.md) THEN the system SHALL return the raw markdown content
2. WHEN an article is in plain text format (.txt) THEN the system SHALL return the plain text content
3. WHEN an article file cannot be read due to encoding issues THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want the read_article tool to be easily integrated with existing agent frameworks, so that it can be used alongside other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the read_article tool is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the standard tool interface pattern used by other agent tools
2. WHEN the read_article tool is called THEN it SHALL return responses in a consistent format with other system tools
3. WHEN integrating with reader_agent THEN the tool SHALL be automatically available without additional configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an agent, I want clear error messages when article loading fails, so that I can handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article file does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a "File not found" error with the searched paths
2. WHEN an article file cannot be read due to permissions THEN the system SHALL return a "Permission denied" error
3. WHEN an article file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL return a "File read error" with details
