TALES OF WONDER

BY

LORD DUNSANY


PREFACE

I hope that this book, coming after "The Gods of PegƒÅna," "Time and the
Gods," "The Sword of Welleran," "A Dreamer's Tales," and "The Book of
Wonder," will be the last of my books about those countries that lie at
the edge of the world. I have written of their gods and of their heroes
and of their desirable cities, and later on I hope to write of our own
times and our own countries; yet I cannot let these other lands fade
from my fancy without writing one tale more, a tale of the end of one of
their cities, so that all my cities beyond the verges of our maps might
not seem to be deathless and eternal when nothing that man knows is.

But whether I leave these lands or not, this at least is certain, that
they will remain as they are; the gates of ivory and horn will not
prevail against them, time will not overwhelm them, they are not
assailable by the years.

DUNSANY.
August 1916.

And the hasheesh-eater made a low obeisance and seated himself with
folded limbs upon a purple cushion, and having eaten liberally of the
drug he began to dream aloud.

"I see a city," said he, "set upon a turbid river, a sinuous river of
muddy waters that has carried the mountainous dirt of many counties
towards the sea..."
