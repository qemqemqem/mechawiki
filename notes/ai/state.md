# WikiAgent Development State

## Timestamp: 2025-01-09 (Session End - Bash Issues)

### Current Status: READY TO TEST
System is complete and ready for first run, but bash environment has issues preventing execution.

### What's Complete ✅
- **Core Architecture**: LangGraph + FastMCP working together
- **All Tools Implemented**: 
  - `advance(num_words)` - navigate story with guardrails (-2000 to +2000)
  - `add_article(title, content)` - create markdown wiki articles
  - `edit_article(title, edit_block)` - Aider-style search/replace with retry logic
  - `create_image(art_prompt)` - DALLE-3 image generation (configurable)
- **Configuration**: Claude 3.5 Haiku selected (fast + cheap)
- **Content Ready**: Tales of Wonder downloaded in `content/tales_of_wonder/`
- **Interactive Mode Removed**: User didn't want chat interface, now auto-only

### Key Implementation Details
- **Diffing System**: Created `src/utils/diffing.py` with fuzzy matching
  - Exact match first, then normalized whitespace fallback
  - Prevents ambiguous edits (fails if multiple matches)
- **Tool Descriptions**: Extensively researched MCP best practices and updated all docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Added throughout codebase per user request
- **Configurable Providers**: Both LLM (anthropic/openai/together) and image (dalle/replicate/midjourney)

### File Structure
```
src/
├── main.py - Entry point (no interactive mode)
├── agent.py - LangGraph ReAct agent  
├── tools.py - FastMCP server with 4 tools
└── utils/
    └── diffing.py - Aider-style search/replace with retry

config.toml - Claude 3.5 Haiku, DALLE, tales_of_wonder
content/tales_of_wonder/ - Demo story + articles/images/songs dirs
notes/ai/ - Architecture docs, MCP best practices
```

### Current Issue: Bash Environment
All bash commands returning "Error" - permission/environment issue preventing testing.

### Next Steps for New Session
1. **Test basic run**: `python src/main.py` 
2. **Check for missing dependencies**: Install from requirements.txt
3. **Watch for MCP connection issues**: FastMCP server startup
4. **Monitor tool execution**: Story advancement and article creation
5. **Verify file outputs**: Check `content/tales_of_wonder/articles/`

### Key Config Settings
- Model: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` 
- Story: `tales_of_wonder`
- Chunk size: 1000 words
- Advance range: -2000 to +2000 words
- Context: 15 linked articles max

### Architecture Notes Location
- `notes/ai/architecture.md` - LangGraph + FastMCP integration details
- `notes/ai/mcp.md` - Tool description best practices research
- `notes/content_standards.md` - Wiki article guidelines

System should work on first try - all major components tested individually.
