# Content Standards

## Article Creation Philosophy

Articles should follow specialized wiki standards similar to fandom wikis (like Wookieepedia for Star Wars) rather than general Wikipedia standards. These wikis are more permissive about:

- **Character articles**: Even minor characters can warrant articles if they have distinct roles, dialogue, or memorable moments
- **Location articles**: Any named place or significant setting gets coverage, from major cities to specific rooms or landmarks
- **Object/Artifact articles**: Important items, weapons, books, or other objects mentioned in the text
- **Event articles**: Key plot events, battles, ceremonies, or significant moments
- **Concept articles**: Magic systems, political structures, religions, customs, or other world-building elements

## Article Structure Guidelines

Each article should include:

1. **Brief introduction** - What/who is this and why is it notable
2. **Detailed description** - Physical appearance, characteristics, or properties
3. **Role in story** - How this element appears or impacts the narrative
4. **Background/History** - Any backstory or context provided
5. **Trivia/Notes** - Interesting details, connections, or analysis

## Notability Threshold

An element merits an article if it:
- Is explicitly named in the text
- Has a meaningful role in advancing plot or character development
- Represents significant world-building detail
- Would be of interest to someone deeply studying the work

## Cross-References

Articles should link to related entries when appropriate, building an interconnected web of content that mirrors the richness of the source material.
