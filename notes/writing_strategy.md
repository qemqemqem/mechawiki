Writing good stories is an art, and it doesn’t come naturally. Some authors might say that that’s an understatement, and the crafting of good stories is tremendous work and we only ever succeed partially. No one strategy for authoring dominates among writers, and different writers have each have their own approach. What follows in this document is therefore intended to inform this project, but in some ways it is more advice than a structure that is set in stone. 

Nonetheless, writers must have their methods, and the agents in this project need to employ a method in order to create good stories. 

Method is differently important for AI agents as it is for humans, because LLMs and humans have different cognitive limitations. AI agents are heavily shaped by context management, and so this needs to be a strategy that works with context management. 

Human authors report that LLM-authored stories tend to lack clear premeditated themes that are consistent throughout the story, so our methods need to promote this. 

On the other hand, LLM authored prose is usually quite strong at the sentence level, so our methods do not need to make up for that quite as much. Nonetheless, LLMs would benefit from making stylistic choices consciously and writing down their intentions, much as humans do. 

# Promises, Progressions, and Payoffs

This system is loosely borrowed from Brandon Sanderson, who has described using it in his fiction. A summary is thus:

- **Promises** are elements in the story that tell the reader that they should pay attention because something will happen later. Classically, Chekov’s Gun is a promise. A promise tells the reader that if they hold something in memory, they’ll get paid off later. For example, it might be a question: “who created the shards of power?”. It might be tension: “how will the Gorev Brothers split their inheritance?”. It might be a latent problem like a diagnosis of cancer.
- **Progressions** are incremental developments to promise. For example, the reader might find a clue about what kind of animal has been raiding the farmhouse. The feuding clerics might have an argument where they escalate their dispute with threats. The character with cancer might start coughing.
- **Payoffs** are conclusions to the promises. They are answers to the questions. It’s the gun finally being fired in anger. It’s the answer to the mystery. It’s not necessarily happy or sad. The detective might catch the thief, or the thief might definitatively get away. Sometimes Payoffs are themselves Progressions, if they don’t cap the subplot in some clear way.

These elements together form a subplot. They should be tracked by the Story Agents in a page in `notes/` dedicated to the subplot. Whenever the story touches on the subplot, the agent should make a note on that page about how it’s progressing. That means that the agent will spend quite a bit of time maintaining these notes. But it’s worth it, because that will allow the story to maintain consistency and structure, and to systematically apply techniques around the rise and fall of tension. 

In general, the Writer and Interactive Agents should avoid advancing the prose in ways that do not serve a Promise in some way. 

## Characters and Promises

Oftentimes, a story is driven forward by character development. In that case, there are still important Promises keyed to characters. For example, if a character is shown to be greedy, that could pay off with them stealing something big, or turning toward generosity at a key moment. 

# Possibilities

When the story introduces a Promise, the author does not need to know exactly how it’s going to end. Murder mystery authors often do not know who the murderer is at the beginning of the story. But, the author should have at least some idea of how it’s going to end. These are called Possibilities. 

- **Possibilities** are Payoffs or Progressions that *may* occur sometime in the future. When the magic ring is introduced, maybe the author thinks that it might have the soul of a genie trapped within it. But, that’s not necessarily going to happen for dozens of pages or more. Or maybe it’s never going to happen. Maybe the ring is haunted by a ghost instead, or maybe it contains the blood of a long-dead mage.

In general, it’s a good idea for all Promises to open with one or more Possibilites. Without that, the writer risks having a strong opening and a weak ending. Stories like *Lost* fell into this trap, introducing Promises that they couldn’t keep. 

Writing down the Possibilities is a good time for the agent to double check that a story line actually has legs. If the Promise sounds cool, but there aren’t any Possibilities that make sense, then the agent should recognize that, and delete or change the plot! 

# Plots for the Reader Agent

When the Reader is reading a story, it should do more than simply record what happens. It should make note of what the author seems to be setting up. It should notice that a potential conflict down the line is being set up, and record it as a Promise. The Reader should even feel free to speculate about the Possibilities! This will give the system the depth to explore an existing story in new and creative ways. Importantly, for interactive stories possible payoffs should be marked as undecided. They may happen but it is up to the interactive agent and researcher to update these as the story progresses so that they make sense and tie into the rest of the story well.
