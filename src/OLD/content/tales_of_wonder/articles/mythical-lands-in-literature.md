# Mythical Lands in Literature

## Context in Lord Dunsany's Work
In the preface to [Tales of Wonder](./tales-of-wonder.md), [Lord Dunsany](./lord-dunsany.md) reflects on his literary exploration of "countries that lie at the edge of the world" - a recurring theme in his writing.

## Key Characteristics
- Lands beyond known geographical maps
- Mythical and fantastical settings
- Timeless and ethereal qualities
- Resistant to conventional temporal limitations

## Dunsany's Philosophical Approach
Dunsany suggests these mythical lands:
- Are not "deathless and eternal"
- Exist beyond conventional understanding
- Transcend typical narrative constraints
- Represent pure imaginative spaces

## Literary Significance
- Pioneering approach to fantasy worldbuilding
- Challenging traditional geographical and narrative boundaries
- Creating mythological landscapes that exist independently of human perception

## Metaphorical Interpretation
The "gates of ivory and horn" reference suggests these lands are products of imagination, existing in a realm between reality and dream.
