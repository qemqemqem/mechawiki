# Story Structure Guide: Promises, Progressions, and Payoffs

## Core Philosophy

Write stories with clear premeditated themes that remain consistent throughout. Make stylistic choices consciously and document your intentions. Manage your context carefully by maintaining detailed notes about your story structure.

## Write Toward a Goal

**Never begin writing prose without authorial goals in mind.** Before you write, define what you want to accomplish with your story. Consider:

### What Thoughts Do You Want to Inspire?
- What ideas should resonate with the reader after they finish?
- What questions do you want them to ponder?
- What insights or perspectives do you want to share?

### What Emotions Do You Want to Evoke?
- Should they feel wonder, fear, joy, melancholy, excitement?
- What emotional journey will they take?
- How will the emotional beats rise and fall?

### What Kind of Story Are You Crafting?
Good writing is compelling because it delivers on one or more of these dimensions:
- **Thought-provoking**: Challenges assumptions, explores ideas, raises questions
- **Emotionally rich**: Creates genuine feeling, builds empathy, touches the heart
- **Educational**: Teaches something meaningful, illuminates truth, shares knowledge
- **Philosophical**: Examines meaning, values, existence, the human condition
- **Thrilling**: Generates excitement, suspense, anticipation, adrenaline
- **Plot-driven**: Delivers satisfying narrative momentum and resolution

**Document your authorial goals** in `notes/authorial_intent.md` before you begin writing. Write toward these goals deliberately. Every scene, every character choice, every plot development should serve your overarching purpose.

## The Promise-Progression-Payoff System

Structure your story around three key elements:

### Promises

**Create Promises** that tell the reader to pay attention because something will happen later. A Promise tells the reader that if they hold something in memory, they'll get paid off later.

Examples:
- **Questions**: "Who created the shards of power?"
- **Tension**: "How will the Gorev Brothers split their inheritance?"
- **Latent Problems**: A character is diagnosed with cancer
- **Chekov's Gun**: Any element you introduce that signals future importance

### Progressions

**Develop Promises incrementally** through Progressions. These are the building blocks that keep the reader engaged while moving toward payoff.

Examples:
- The reader finds a clue about what kind of animal has been raiding the farmhouse
- Feuding clerics escalate their dispute with threats during an argument
- The character with cancer starts coughing

### Payoffs

**Deliver conclusions** to your Promises. Answer the questions. Fire the gun. Resolve the mystery. Payoffs don't need to be happy or sad - the detective might catch the thief, or the thief might definitively get away.

**Note**: Some Payoffs are also Progressions if they don't fully cap the subplot.

## Tracking Subplots

**Create a dedicated notes page** for each subplot in the `notes/` directory. Track:
- The initial Promise
- Each Progression as it occurs
- Planned or potential Payoffs
- How each story beat serves this subplot

**Update these notes frequently**. Whenever the story touches on a subplot, make a note about how it's progressing. This will allow your story to maintain consistency and structure, and to systematically apply techniques around the rise and fall of tension.

**Maintain discipline**: Avoid advancing the prose in ways that do not serve a Promise in some way.

## Characters and Promises

**Drive your story through character development** by keying Promises to characters:
- If a character is shown to be greedy, pay it off with them stealing something big, or turning toward generosity at a key moment
- Character flaws are Promises
- Character goals are Promises
- Character relationships are Promises

## Possibilities: Planning Without Overplanning

**Don't lock yourself in too early**. When you introduce a Promise, you don't need to know exactly how it will end. But you should have some ideas.

### Define Possibilities

**Possibilities** are Payoffs or Progressions that *may* occur sometime in the future. They give you flexibility while ensuring you have legs to stand on.

Example: When you introduce a magic ring, consider:
- Maybe it has the soul of a genie trapped within it
- Maybe it's haunted by a ghost
- Maybe it contains the blood of a long-dead mage

**Write down at least one Possibility** for every Promise you create. This is your safety net. Use this as a checkpoint: if a Promise sounds cool but you can't think of any Possibilities that make sense, delete or change that plot element! Don't fall into the *Lost* trap of making Promises you can't keep.

## Practical Workflow

1. **Before writing a new story**, create `notes/authorial_intent.md` documenting your goals, themes, and intended impact
2. **Before writing a new subplot**, create `notes/subplot_[name].md`
3. **Document the Promise** - What question or tension are you introducing?
4. **List Possibilities** - What are 2-3 ways this could pay off?
5. **As you write**, update the notes with each Progression
6. **When you deliver the Payoff**, mark it clearly in your notes
7. **Review your notes** before each writing session to maintain consistency with your authorial goals

## Quality Check

**Call `done()` only when the story is complete.** A complete story means all Promises have been paid off. If you have introduced Promises that haven't been resolved, you have two options:

1. **Add the Payoff** - Continue writing to deliver the resolution
2. **Edit Earlier Content** - Use `edit_file()` to remove or modify the Promise if you decide not to pursue it

Before calling `done()`, ask yourself:
- **Have I defined my authorial goals?** What thoughts and emotions am I trying to evoke?
- **Am I writing toward those goals?** Does this content serve my intended impact?
- **Have ALL Promises been paid off?** Review your subplot tracking notes - no open Promises should remain
- Does every scene serve at least one Promise?
- Are my Progressions moving the story forward?
- Have I updated my subplot tracking notes?
- **Is this compelling?** Am I delivering thought-provoking, emotionally rich, thrilling, or philosophical content?

**Don't leave Promises hanging.** Unfulfilled Promises frustrate readers and undermine your story. Either pay them off or edit them out before calling `done()`.

Stay the course. Write with structure, energy, and purpose! 🏰✍️
